# Buildtools Project
This project was created to show basic examples of Ant and Gradle.

### Goals
1. Ant Basics
  *
2. Gradle Basics
  *

### To Run the Ant project

* Make sure you have Ant installed.  The examples were written with Ant 1.9.3.

**Files**
* build1.xml - A simple ant file with hard coded values.
* build2.xml - The same file using properties rather than hard coded values.

To run, rename one of the build files above to *build.xml* and then run 'ant'.

### To Run the Gradle project

* Make sure you have Gradle installed.  The examples were written with Gradle 2.4.

**Files**
* build1.gradle - A simple gradle build.
* build2.gradle - More complex example.

To run, rename one of the build files above to *build.gradle* and then run 'gradle'.
